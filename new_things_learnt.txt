setting the body to h-screen gives it 100vh 
so that the bg image could take the full height

generally bg images are set onto the section tag
big whole outer container


when the flex items are too big they cannot be justified or
aligned thus i had to delete that container class
written with the flex container div
to give the children some space to be centered and aligned


i had to set each flex child to grow so that it could take 
the full width
